   <h3>CIS 706/801: Translator Design I & II, Fall 2023</h3>

----

.. include:: def.rst

Purpose
*******

The course will teach modern compiler techniques applied to general-purpose
programming language.
The goal of the course is to give students a working knowledge of the
foundations, tools, and engineering approaches used in developing formal
language translators.
The emphasis is on the construction of compilers to position students to build
translators for little languages in their careers.


Course Topics
*************

Compilers and interpreters, including description of languages, finite state
scanners, parsing, symbol tables, syntax directed semantics, code generation,
and static analysis.


Philosophy
**********

This course is based on a course that was originally designed by
|Laurie J. Hendren| and |Michael I. Schwartzbach| which has been taught at a
number of universities over the past decade.
The course received a significant update by |Robby| and |Matthew B. Dwyer| in
2005 with respect to the projects and the tools that are used for compiler
implementation; this update achieves a modernization of compiler construction
technologies.
This is primarily an introductory compiling course that has been designed to
recognize that most people will not build a large application like a compiler
from scratch and that people learn by doing.
Towards this end, the project for the course involves the enhancement of an
existing compiler code base.
Students will be given a working compiler and will be required to extend it in
significant ways.
This will give them insights into how a compiler is designed and written that
they can leverage for their enhancements.
While serving this purpose, the course does present significantly more content
on static analysis than is typically found in an introductory compiling course;
thus it can serve as an effective introduction on advanced topics for graduate
students.

Grading Policy
**************

The course :ref:`schedule` page gives the due dates for all of the homework.
This is to facilitate your planning and time-management.
Given this, we expect assignments to be turned in on the due date unless prior
arrangements have been made; late assignments receive a reduction of 1% of the
total possible points for each hour after the due date/time.


Grading Scale
*************

Course grades are absolute, that is, there is no curve, and will be calculated
based on your overall percentage on assignments as follows:

* A: 90% -- 100%

* B: 80% -- 89%

* C: 70% -- 79%

* D: 60% -- 69%

* F: below 60%

There is one additional constraint on your final grade.
To receive a letter grade of A, you must achieve at least a B on one of the exams.
Similarly, to receive a B you must achieve a C, C you must achieve a D on one of the
exams. 


Computer Access
***************

This course involves a lot of programming, and it makes significant use of 
software tools. 
Many of these can be accessed by you (for free) and installed on your own 
machine.
If you prefer, we have everything you need on our CIS department machines so you
can get an account on our machines.
See the :ref:`notes` page for information on how to get an account and use our
machines.


Attendance Policy
*****************

In general, there will be NO make-up quizzes or exams!
Special consideration will be given in only exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are generally limited to:

* **Emergencies:** death in student's immediate family, or 
  near-death experience of the student.

* **Non-emergencies:** certified excused absences for official university activities.

If you believe you qualify for exceptional treatment, you must notify the
instructor prior to the date of the quiz or exam to be missed.


Statement Regarding Academic Honesty
************************************

Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, 
which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, 
one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance.
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of
the Honor and Integrity System.
The policies and procedures of the `Honor and Integrity System <https://www.k-state.edu/honor/>`__ apply to all full and 
part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, 
and via distance learning.
A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge
which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."
A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course;
the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.


Statement Regarding Students with Disabilities
**********************************************

At K-State it is important that every student has access to course content and 
the means to demonstrate course mastery. Students with disabilities may benefit 
from services including accommodations provided by the Student Access Center.
Disabilities can include physical, learning, executive functions, and mental health.

You may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to assist your learning in this course, 
including idea generation and grammar assessments for written assignments.
However, you are prohibited from using generative AI tools to completely produce,
reproduce, and/or manufacture paper and/or other assignments without using any personal
effort devoted to the learning process.
If you choose to use AI appropriately, you are expected to provide a citation for it
using the following format: “Title of AI Tool. Prompt or brief description of topic of
search depending on tool. Date of creation.”
Using an AI tool to generate assignment content without proper attribution would be a
violation of the `K-State Honor Pledge <https://www.k-state.edu/honor/basics/pledge.html>`__.

Other Administrative Issues

* **Incompletenes:** An incomplete (I) final grade will be given only by prior
  arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to departmental policy in
  which the bulk of course work has been completed in passing fashion.

* **Drop Policy:** It is your responsibility to drop the course if you are
  enrolled but decide not to complete the course --- there are no "automatic"
  drops due to nonattendance.
  The University allows a retake of a course with removal of the prior grade,
  at most once per course, for a maximum of five courses.

* **Copyright Issues:** Class and lecture notes for this course carry a
